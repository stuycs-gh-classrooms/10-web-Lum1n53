      ORV is just a really good light novel and Manhwa. Great plot, great character development, and great world building. Trust me, it's good. I will add a link to the light novel.
      Here is the list of the main characters.

    <ul><li>Kim Dokja</li> <li>Yoo Jonghyuk</li> <li>Han Sooyung</li></ul>
