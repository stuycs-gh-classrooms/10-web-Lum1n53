      ORV is just a really good light novel and Manhwa. Great plot, great character development, and great world building. Trust me, it's good. I will add a link to the light novel.
      Here is the list of the main characters.

    <ul>
      <li>Kim Dokja</li>
      <li>Yoo Joonhyuk</li>
      <li>Han Sooyoung</li>
    </ul>

      This is what the art looks like if you are interested in the character designs
