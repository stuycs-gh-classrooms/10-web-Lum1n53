    <h1>Han Sooyoung</h1>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        He is an obsessive reader for a light novel called "Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined world" he discovered in a time of need. The light novel has 3149 chapters and it's the most boring and tedious story a person can ever read.
      However, he doesn't care, and he will read it as it's only reader. It nicely reflects his name 獨子 or 독자 both have the same pronunciation but have different meanings.
      The first one means "only child" while the second one means "reader. Both are traits that he expresses as the story progreses.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the world in the light novel comes to reality he does anything he can to see his ideal epilogue. When I mean anything I mean his tendency to sacrafice himself
      For his party members. Seriously the amount of times he "sacraficed" himself is a joke amongst the ORV fanbase. Though most his party members are characters from the story,
      he still can't help but love all of them equally. He really does care about them even if he does traumautize them every time he sarcrafices himself.

    <h2><a href="https://freewebnovel.org/free-novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/chapter-532">Personal Favorite Chapter</a></h2>
    <p>
      This chapter reveals the background of Han Sooyoung before the disasters. It explains all the weird things about her character while also showing how much she cares about Kim Dokja.
      Her present self in the disasters went back into the body of her younger self with the intent to find and stop the writer of "Ways of Survival" into writing the story to prevent the damage
      caused by the story. However, upon realizing that Dokja would've given up on life without the novel she decides to write the novel herself and become the one who brought the disasters upon the world.
