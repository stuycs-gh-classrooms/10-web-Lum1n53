    <h1>Han Sooyoung</h1>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
      Han Sooyoung was a writer before the scenarios began. Once the story started she was a selfish survivor. Prioritizing her own saftey over others, always acting alone.
      However, for reasons unknown at the time the scenarios followed the story she wrote "SSSSS-Grade Infinite Regressor" which was in her oppinion the better version of "Ways of Survival".
      Sooner or later when she met the person who accused her of plagarism pre-scenarios, Kim Dokja, she was forced to team up with him and eventually became one of the main party members.
      Eventually she grew a liking to his personality and using her quick thinking and wit she became the leader of the party when Kim Dokja was not around.

    <h2><a href="https://freewebnovel.org/free-novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/chapter-532">Personal Favorite Chapter</a></h2>
    <p>
      This chapter reveals the background of Han Sooyoung before the scenarios. It explains all the weird things about her character while also showing how much she cares about Kim Dokja.
      Her present self in the disasters went back into the body of her younger self with the intent to find and stop the writer of "Ways of Survival" into writing the story to prevent the damage
      caused by the story. However, upon realizing that Dokja would've given up on life without the novel she decides to write the novel herself and become the one who brought the scenarioss upon the world.
