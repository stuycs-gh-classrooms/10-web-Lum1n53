    <h1>Kim Dokja</h1>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        He is an obsessive reader for a light novel called "Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined world" he discovered in a time of need. The light novel has 3149 chapters and it's the most boring and tedious story a person can ever read.
      However, he doesn't care, and he will read it as it's only reader. It nicely reflects his name 獨子 or 독자 both have the same pronunciation but have different meanings.
      The first one means "only child" while the second one means "reader. Both are traits that he expresses as the story progreses.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the world in the light novel comes to reality he does anything he can to see his ideal epilogue. When I mean anything I mean his tendency to sacrafice himself
      For his party members. Seriously the amount of times he "sacraficed" himself is a joke amongst the ORV fanbase. Though most his party members are characters from the story,
      he still can't help but love all of them equally. He really does care about them even if he does traumautize them every time he sarcrafices himself.
