    <h1>Yoo Joonghyuk</h1>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
      Yoo Joonghyuk is the protagonist of the light novel that Kim Dokja reads called "Ways of Survival". He is an regressor who went back in time countless times and expierience the same tragedies
      over and over again. Despite all this he remains strong and forges on. He is often described as a cold and unyielding person. All his party members are somewhat afraid him. Kim Dokja is the only one
      who truly knows him for who he is. His mission throughout his regressions is to see the ending of the scenarios. He has countless strategies and abilities and is the strongest on the team.
      He is often put in the role of a leader on any commisions or quests. He is the powerhouse of the party.

    <h2><a href="https://freewebnovel.org/free-novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/chapter-187">Personal Favorite Chapter</a></h2>
    <p>
      Honestly the one of the best arcs, in my oppinion. It shows Yoo Joonghyuk, who has been alone throughout the scenarios with no one to truly call his companion, being forced to kill
      his only friend, Kim Dokja. It really shows how the normally stoic main character of "Ways of Survival" has his weak sides when coming to people he genuinely cares about. Kim Dokja
      once again shined a light to another character. He willingly sacrafices himself (again) for the sake of minimizing his party's harm. Yoo Joonghyuk being more reluctant than ever, chooses
      what is best for his, Han Sooyoung, and Kim Dokja's party, and pierces Kim Dokja's heart.

        <li>
          It allows Yoo Joonghyuk to go back to the start of the Scenarios. It activates automatically upon near death situations or when he does it automatically.
          Memories and some skills are retained while equipment and [stories] are lost. Essentially allows him to replay the scenarios until he succeeds.

      <li>Regression Depression</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An attribute gained through hundreds regressions. Main cause is the fact that Yoo Joonghyuk fails to protect someone once again and replays the suffering over and over
          until he gets over it. It puts him in a trance-like state.

          In Yoo Joonghyuk's first turn also known as the 0th turn, he has no knowledge of the scenarios and the tragedies ahead. This ability allows him to gain immense luck through
          the Demon King of Salvation (aka: Kim Dokja's constellation name). The price is that he loses 25 years of his life for this ability. He only gains this ability once.
