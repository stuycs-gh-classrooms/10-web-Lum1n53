    <h1>Omnisicent Reader Viewpoints three main leads.</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kim Dokja</li>
      <li>Yoo Jonghyuk</li>
      <li>Han Sooyung</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Kim Dokja</h2>
    <p>
      He is the main protagonist of the story. He read a 3149 chapter light novel for the majority of his life and it suddenly came to his world causing disasters around the world.
      Now he is the only one in the world knowing everything about the story and he will do anything to see the conclusion. He doesn't follow the classic overpowered protagonist
      trope and is filled with flaws. He is a very enjoyable character to read about.
    </p>
    <h2>Yoo Jonghyuk</h2>
    <p>
      He is the protagonist of the light novel that Kim Dokja was reading. He is a regressor who relived the disasters countless of times. Each time his mental state gets worst and worst.
      However, this is only his "3rd" turn and you'll see how he and his only reader will interact. He may seem to have harsh personality at first glance, but the more you read about him
      you will see the reason for why he acts the way he does. Replaying and failing over and over does take a toll on the human mind.
    </p>
    <h2>Han Sooyung</h2>
    <p>
      There is so much things I want to talk about this character but that will be a jungle of spoilers I have to avoid. So I will just tell you about her personality.
      She is a writer and she will do anything to stay alive in this disaster. She clashed with Dokja before they meet in the disaster and you will see how their relatioship
      grows as the story goes on.
